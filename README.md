# lubelogger-ja-jp

Japanese translation (ja_JP) for LubeLogger, localized for Japanese car and motorcycle users.

---

## Overview

This repository provides a Japanese translation file (`ja_JP.json`) for LubeLogger.

This translation is **not a literal word-for-word translation**.  
It focuses on localization for real-world usage in Japan, especially for private car and motorcycle owners.

The primary goals are usability, clarity, and cultural alignment rather than strict fidelity to the original English text.

---

## Translation Policy

This translation follows these principles:

- Prioritizes terminology commonly used by Japanese car and motorcycle users
- Focuses on practical usability over literal translation
- Avoids forced translation of concepts that are uncommon or unclear in Japan
- Maintains functional consistency without breaking application behavior
- Prefers leaving original text rather than introducing misleading translations

As a result, some labels may differ significantly from the original English wording,  
but application usage remains consistent and non-breaking.

## Intentionally Untranslated or Partially Translated Sections

Some sections are intentionally left untranslated or only partially translated:

- Tabs rarely used in Japan (e.g. Equipment, Inspections)
- Server-side configuration and advanced system settings
- Features without a commonly understood concept in Japan (e.g. Vehicle Map)

This is a deliberate choice to avoid low-quality or misleading translations.
